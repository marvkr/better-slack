This project replaces workplace chat with an AI-native task router. Instead of asking coworkers through messages, people express intent in plain language—what needs to be done and by when. A central AI takes ownership of coordination: it understands team capacity, skills, priorities, and deadlines, then decides whether to route the task to the best-suited teammate or handle it itself. During execution, requests are anonymized to remove social bias, politics, and passive-aggressive dynamics, so work is evaluated purely on merit and urgency.

When a task can be completed by AI—summarization, research, writing, analysis—it is executed autonomously without involving a human at all, saving time for everyone. For human-assigned work, the AI manages progress updates, reminders, and reassignment if deadlines are at risk, keeping requesters informed without interruptions or “just checking in” messages. The result is a calmer, fairer way to work: humans focus on high-leverage tasks, while AI owns coordination and eliminates unnecessary work entirely.
